# python

In this activity I was given two different datasets and tasked with creating a python script that analyzed the activity in each.  

The first (“Pybank”) involved a csv file containing financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset was composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. I created a Python script that read the csv then analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
    •	The total number of months included in the dataset
    •	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    •	The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    •	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    •	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results. Below is an example of the code I wrote, and the output generated.

 

 

In the “Pypoll” challenge, I was given another .csv with a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  Again, I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following:
    •	The total number of votes cast
    •	A complete list of candidates who received votes
    •	The percentage of votes each candidate won
    •	The total number of votes each candidate won
    •	The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
